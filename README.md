dotfiles are used to customize your system. The “dotfiles” name is derived from the configuration files in Unix-like systems that start with a dot. This helps with moving between systems easily and stored as a backup.

Feel free to use and steal bits as you see fit as most of my own setup is taken from bits I've found from other people.

<h2> What I use </h2>
